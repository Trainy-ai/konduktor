Konduktor is a source available Run:AI alternative built on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io). Konduktor uses existing open source tools to build a platform that makes it easy for ML Researchers to submit batch jobs and for administrative/infra teams to easily manage GPU clusters.

## How it works

Konduktor uses a combination of open source projects. Where tools exist with MIT, Apache, or another compatible open license, we want to use and even contribute to that tool. Where we see gaps in tooling, we build it and open source ourselves.

### Architecture

Konduktor can be self-hosted and run on any certified Kubernetes distribution or managed by us. Contact us at founders@trainy.ai if you are just interested in the managed version. We're focused on tooling for clusters with NVIDIA cards for now but in the future we may expand to our scope to support other accelerators.

For ML researchers
- [Skypilot](https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/index.html) - user friendly batch job framework, where users only need to specify the resource requirements of their job and a script to launch that makes simple to scale work across multiple nodes. Works with most ML application frameworks. [Examples](https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot/tree/master/examples)
